          described in this Privacy Policy include the following explanations:

          <li>How we share information; and</li>
          <li>The choices we offer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect:</h4>
        <p>
          We may ask you for, or you may voluntarily submit, personally
          identifiable information when you are using the Service (“Confidential
          Information”). The personally identifiable information which you may
          provide to us could include, but is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your name</li>
          <li>
            Your contact information (including, without limitation, postal
            address and email address);

        </ul>
        <p>
          Once you have provided and have successfully validated your Instagram
          Account we may collect the following personally identifiable
          information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Instagram username</li>
          <li>Your Instagram profile picture URL</li>
          <li>Your Instagram Biography</li>
          <li>Your Recent Posts</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Non-Personal Or Aggregate Information That We Collect:</h4>
        <p>
          When you access our Service, we may automatically collect
          non-personally identifiable information from you, such as IP host
          address, web pages viewed, browser type, operating system, referring
          service, search information, device type, page views, usage and
          browsing habits on the Service and similar data. You may offer or
          provide a comment, image, video or any other submission to us when
          visiting or interacting with our Website and its Content, which we may
          collect as Information. Once you have successfully validated your
          Instagram Account, we may automatically collect non- personally
          identifiable information such as Number of Followers, Total likes and
          comments for "recent posts" (most recent 20 posts). We may also
          aggregate demographic information collected from our users (such as
          the number of users in a particular geographical location) in a manner
          which does not identify any one individual. We may also aggregate
          information collected offline in connection with the Service, obtain
          non-personally identifiable information from third party sources and
          develop aggregate information by anonymizing previously collected
          personally identifiable information.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable
          information through automatic means that we may unintentionally
          collect or receive personally identifiable information that is mixed
          in with the non-personally identifiable information. While we will
          make reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data collection,
          the possibility still exists. If you believe that we have
          inadvertently collected your personal information, please notify us at
          support@mentionup.com.
        </p>
        <h4>Information Usage:</h4>

            we may share your information with SendPulse, for the purpose of
            sending emails. We urge you to read the privacy practices of all our
            Third- Party Vendors before submitting any personally identifiable

          Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief

          We will obtain your consent to collect, use or disclose personal
          information except where we are authorized or required by law to do so
          without consent. For example, we may collect, use or disclose personal

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The information is publicly available, as defined by statute or
            regulation; · We are obtaining legal advice; or
          </li>
          <li>
            We reasonably expect that obtaining consent would compromise an
            investigation or proceeding.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other exceptions may apply.</p>

        <p>

          representative such as a lawyer, agent or broker. Consent may be
          provided orally, in writing, electronically, through inaction (such as
          when you fail to notify us that you do not wish for your personal
          information to be collected / used / disclosed for various purposes
          after you have received notice of those purposes) or otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal, contractual
          and other restrictions, provided that you give reasonable notice of

        </p>

        <p>
          The security of your personally identifiable information is very
          important to us. When we collect your personally identifiable
          information online, we use reasonable efforts to protect it from
          unauthorized access. However, due to the inherent open nature of the
          Internet, we cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable
          information will be completely free from unauthorized access by third
          parties such as hackers and your use of our Service demonstrates your
          assumption of this risk. We have put in place reasonable physical,
          electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we
          collect.
        </p>

          Information, or who have a legitimate need to know such Confidential
          Information.
        </p>

          faith belief that such action is necessary, particularly when
          disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
          against someone who may be causing injury to others or interfering
          with our rights or property.

          technologies to help us analyze how users use the Service. The
          information generated by these services about your use of the Service
          (including your IP address or a truncated version of your IP address)
          is transmitted to and stored by analytics service providers on their
          servers. Those service providers will use this information for the
          purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of the Service,
          compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other
          services relating to website activity and Internet usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may collect information about your computer, including your IP
          address, operating system and browser type, for system administration
          and in order to create reports. This is statistical data about our
          users’ browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any
          individual. For example, we may use cookies on our Website for
          Analytics Services. The Analytics Service is a web-based analytics
          tool that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with
          their website and creates informational reports in order to help us
          improve our Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Analytics Service collects information anonymously. They report
          website trends without identifying individual visitors.
        </p>

        <h4>Automatically Collected Information:</h4>
        <p>
          When you access the Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may
          automatically record certain information from your system by using
          cookies and other types of tracking technologies. This "automatically
          collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP
          Address"), a unique user ID, device type, device identifiers, browser
          types and language, referring and exit pages, platform type, version
          of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you
          access on the Service, the number of clicks, the amount of time spent
          on pages, the dates and times that you visit the Service, and other
          similar information. Depending on the law of your country of
          residence, your IP address may legally be considered personally
          identifiable information.
        </p>
        <h4>Your Disclosures In Blogs And Other Social Media:</h4>
        <p>
          You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you
          voluntarily include and transmit online on the Service or in a
          publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or
          otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum such as an
          in-person panel or survey, may be viewed and used by others without
          any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your
          personally identifiable information, and by using the Service or any
          other online services you assume the risk that the personally
          identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by
          third parties for any number of purposes.
        </p>
        <h4>Other Services:</h4>
        <p>
          Certain third-party service providers, such as payment transaction
          processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the
          information we are required to provide to them for your
          purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we recommend that
          you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
          which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
          The privacy policies for our payment transaction processors is located
          at
        </p>

          <li>BlueSnap: https://home.bluesnap.com/privacy-policy/</li>
          <li>PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or
          have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than
          either you or us. So, if you elect to proceed with a transaction that
          involves the services of a third-party service provider, be aware that
          your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s)
          in which that service provider or its facilities are located. As an
          example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is
          processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your
          personal information used in completing that transaction may be
          subject to disclosure under United States legislation.
