The dispute resolution is accessible at any time during the job life span but is recommended to be used as a last resort when the buyer and seller cannot come to an agreement.</li>

Users can also include a message to explain the reason for the dispute, which is sent to a MentionUP representative who has access to view the job log. The representative may communicate with both parties in question. The MentionUP representative will create a resolution based on the information they are given. MentionUP has the final decision on any and all disputes. By using the Services provided by MentionUP, the User acknowledges and agrees that all dispute settlements will be based on the information provided by each user, and ultimately resolved by the sole discretion of MentionUP. These are final and binding decisions and there is no re-examination. </li>
